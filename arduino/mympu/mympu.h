/*
  24 Sep Initial Commit, tested with {gyro_scope, proscilloscope, kalman_binary}.py
  27 Sep getReadings() is sub-optimal [read comment in ~.cpp to see why.]
         Interrupts from MPU are now optional via <mode> arg to mpu_init()
____________________________________________________________________________________________
FEATURES
+ Cleaner, unified method of comms. with MPU via I2CDevLib commands.
+ cal_mpu_off(mode) writes offset values into eeprom for later use. Makes bootup faster and
  these offsets determine the "home" position. If cal_mpu_off() is used at every bootup, a tilted
  starting orientation would be interpreted as flat, causing a catastrophe!
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  | cal_mpu_off(mode) MUST BE USED ONLY WHEN DEVICE IS LEVEL! |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
+ cfgr_mpu_off() MUST BE USED FOR USUAL TAKEOFFS
____________________________________________________________________________________________
NOTES
*  I2C operations are extremely costly. Minimise them in the loop() or else... 
     -  1  byte   480us
     -  2  bytes  580us
     - 12 bytes  1580us

*_* This can be reduced by a factor of ~4 if twi.h CONSTANTS are changed so that the
*_* I2C bus communicates @ 400kHz rather than standard 100kHz
*_* OR we use FastWire library for I2C rather than the default Wire library. I2Cdev works
*_* with both!!
